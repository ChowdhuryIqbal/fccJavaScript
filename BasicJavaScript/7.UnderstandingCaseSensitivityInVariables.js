/*
    Variable naming and declaration in JavaScript is case sensitive.
    That means MYVAR is not the same as MyVar nor myvar
*/

// good practice is to write variable and function names with camelCase
// Also, giving meaningful names to variables accroding to the problem is important

// Variable declarations
var studlyCapVar;
var properCamelCase;
var titleCaseOver;

// Variable assignments
studlyCapVar = 10;
properCamelCase = "A String";
titleCaseOver = 9000;
