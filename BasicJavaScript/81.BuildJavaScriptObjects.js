/*
Objects are similar to arrays, except that instead
of using indexes to access and modify their data, 
you access the data in objects through what are called properties.

Objects are useful for storing data in a structured way,
and can represent real world objects, like a cat.

var cat = {
    "name": "Whiskers",
    "legs": 2,
    "tails": 1,
    "enemies": ["Water", "Dogs"]
};
*/

var myDog = {
    // Only change code below this line
    "name": 'cats',
    "legs": 2,
    "tails": 1,
    "friends": ['birds', 'wolves']
    // Only change code above this line
};
